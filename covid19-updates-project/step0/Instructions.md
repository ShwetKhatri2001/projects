Hello there, welcome to the first step of the Covid19 Updates Web tutorial. We will be using `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `BOOTSTRAP` and `JS` to build this project.

Go through the `README.md` file to get a better idea of the project.

Before starting the project, make sure that you clearly understand the requirements:

- Get the Covid19 specific API data listed when required such as Covid-19 cases worldwide, countrywise, statewise, districtwise, daywise etc.

- Create other informative sections of the website such as "About Cpvid-19", "Coronavirus Symptoms",
  "6 Steps For Prevention Against Corona Virus" and "Contact Us ASAP".

- Maintain the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Now that you have understood the basic requirements, hop on to the next step and start building the it!
