As given in the steps, just create a responsive navbar first having a title on the left and links on the right.
You can use Bootstrap to make it responsive.
The links can be these: "Home", "Everyday Updates", "Symptoms", "Prevention" and "Contact".

Next below it, create a banner section having an image on the left part and right part can have a bold encouraging text such as such as 'Lets Stay Safe & Fight against Corona Virus'.
