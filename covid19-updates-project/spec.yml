  Your challenge is to build out this frontend page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  Also, it should work fine with REST API integration.

  This project focuses mostly on HTML, JS, CSS and Bootstrap.
  JS is used to integrate REST APIs and handle contaact form.
  Bottstrap can be used to make responsive layouts, its your choise.

  You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

  Your users should be able to:

  - Get the specific API data listed when required such as Covid-19 cases worldwide, countrywise, statewise, districtwise, daywise etc.

  - View other sections of the website such as "About Cpvid-19", "Coronavirus Symptoms", 
    "6 Steps For Prevention Against Corona Virus" and "Contact Us ASAP".

  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

  - See hover states and click events for all interactive elements on the page

  - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.html` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
